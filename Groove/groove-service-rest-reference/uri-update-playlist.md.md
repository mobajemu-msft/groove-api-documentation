# POST (/1/content/{namespace}/collection/playlists/update)
Update a playlist on behalf of a user.

-   [Remarks](#remarks)
-   [Examples](#examples)

## Remarks
The full update request is composed of mandatory and optional URL parts and query parameters. A request containing all parameters would resemble the following string:

```http
/1/content/{namespace}/collection/playlists/update?accessToken={accessToken}
```

You can update only one playlist at a time. Provide the ID of the playlist to be updated, the metadata you want to update, and a list of actions to perform on the playlist's tracks.

You can add and remove tracks from the playlist, or reorder existing tracks in the playlist. As with other edit APIs, when some sub-operations fail (such as adding a track), you will receive an HTTP 200 error with a non-null Error field. You can determine the failure by looking at the Error fields of the sub-operations.

Playlist names are restricted to 256 characters and cannot be empty.

## Examples
Request object: [PlaylistAction (JSON)](JSON-PlaylistAction.md).

Response object: [PlaylistActionResponse (JSON)](JSON-PlaylistActionResponse.md).

### Update playlist metadata
You can use this API to update the name of a playlist and control whether it's published, read-only, or both.

#### Request
```http
POST /1/content/music/collection/playlists/update?accessToken=Bearer+[...]

Authorization: Bearer eyJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDK0hTMjU2Iiw[...]

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Id": "music.playlist.88195f49-8008-00fe-a87e-5774b0384ad1",
  "Name": "Fill me up with love",
  "IsPublished": true
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
  "PlaylistActionResult": {
    "Id": "music.playlist.88195f49-8008-00fe-a87e-5774b0384ad1",
    "Name": "Fill me up with love",
    "IsPublished": true
  }
}
```

### Update playlist metadata and tracks
You can update both metadata and tracks in the same call. Provide a list of actions to perform on tracks (only add and delete are supported for now), with the IDs of the tracks. To add tracks you only need to provide catalog IDs (obtainable from a search or lookup), but for delete you need to provide collection IDs obtained by looking up the collection or the playlist.

In this example, we add a track and delete one. Both operations are successful.

    },
    {

      "Action": "Add"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Response
```json

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Add an invalid track to a playlist
If you add an invalid track to a playlist, you'll receive a non-null [Error](JSON-Error.md) field at the sub-operation level, and an Error at the top-level saying that some sub-operations failed. You must parse the sub-operations to determine the failure.

In this example, we try to add a random GUID as a track ID to a playlist.

#### Request
```http
POST /1/content/music/collection/playlists/update?accessToken=Bearer+[...]

Authorization: Bearer eyJlbmMiOiJBMTI4Q0JDK0hTMjU2Iiw[...]

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "Id": "music.playlist.88195f49-8008-00fe-a87e-5774b0384ad1",
  "TrackActions": [
    {
      "Id": "music.E8AEDB01-23D6-4659-9916-2349BE9F9C26",
      "Action": "Delete"
    }
  ]
}
```
#### Response
```json
{
  "PlaylistActionResult": {
    "Id": "music.playlist.88195f49-8008-00fe-a87e-5774b0384ad1",
    "TrackActionResults": [
      {
        "InputId": "music.E8AEDB01-23D6-4659-9916-2349BE9F9C26",
        "Error": {
          "ErrorCode": "COLLECTION-INVALID-ID",
          "Description": "Invalid collection id for this operation"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "Error": {
    "ErrorCode": "COLLECTION-SOME-OPERATIONS-FAILED",
    "Description": "Some of the operations failed"
  }
}
```

### Reorder tracks in a playlist
You can reorder tracks inside a playlist using this API. A reorder operation can only contain Move operations (cannot be mixed with Add and Delete operations).

A reorder operation must match an atomic user input: selecting a list of tracks in the playlist, and inserting them before another track.

Use the InsertBeforeTrackId field for the track before which you want to insert, and fill the TrackActions field with the tracks that should move to that new position.
