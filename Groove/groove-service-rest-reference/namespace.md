# Namespaces supported
The Groove APIs use namespaces to indicate the type of content that is being referenced or asked for, and to separate ID spaces. All of the content IDs returned in content API responses are always prefixed with their namespace. For example, ``` music.{ID} ```identifies a particular piece of music content. The namespaces should be considered as part of the ID when passing a specific ID in a request.

Some namespaces have associated sub-namespaces that can identify other secondary or third-party IDs for the same content types. For example, the ```music``` namespace is used to prefix Groove IDs, but some of the Groove pieces of content can also be referenced by third-party IDs such as AMG IDs (using the sub-namespace ```music.amg```). Some of those sub-namespaces can be used as input in a limited set of scenarios (see table below).
