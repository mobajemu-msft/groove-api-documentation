| Tracks            | List of [Track](JSON_Track.md)             | A paginated list of the album's tracks. This list is null by default unless requested as extra information in a lookup request. If not null, it should most often be full without the need to use a continuation token; only a few cases of albums containing a very large number of tracks will use pagination. Tracks in this list contain only a few fields, including the ID that should be used in a lookup request in order to have the full track properties. |
